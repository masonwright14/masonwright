This is a repository of code samples.
Feel free to reuse however you like.

I code mostly in Java, so the Java examples are the most extensive. When I first learned to program, Perl was my language,
so the Perl examples are clever but also relatively naive.

I have lots more Java and JavaScript code from work that I can't post.

Check out the Java Play! framework web app I built for a museum exhibit at MoMA!
